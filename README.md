# AWSpotify

AWSpotify uses Spotfy API to search among spotify's huge collection of songs. It plays the song preview (30 seconds).

Also, a bridging header has been added to the project as it uses spotifySDK written in objective-C. (only the authorisation SDK used in this project/POC

Along side the project contains an example use of Alamofire in swift 3. Separate queues has been used, here a queue for parsing and back into the main queue when we touch UI elements.

An example of inter-app communication, here our web browser and our app has been included.

This project has been done as an entry technical test into an outsourcing company named Ingima.
